# UFO Sightings in United States
## The Truth is Out There!


**A Interactive Data Visualization exploring the correlation between the Spatial distribution and Temporal occurrences of UFO sightings across the USA**

![Apr-04-2024 19-19-53](https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/USA-UFO-Sightings-VIZ/assets/85262444/cc42723e-2cdb-4bfb-a6f0-bf79d8daa628)

<h2>Description</h2>

In our project, "UFO Sightings in United States: The Truth is out there" , we embarked on a journey to explore and visualize a comprehensive dataset compiled by the National UFO Reporting Center. This dataset, spanning over a century of reports from around the world, offers a unique window into the collective human experience with the unexplained aerial phenomena. We filtered the comprehensive dataset to provide us with information about UFO sightings in the United States, and used that to analyze the data and displayed it using a Leaflet map, along with 4 charts and a word cloud.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Navigate to your folder. Eg: for home directory

```
cd ~
```

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/USA-UFO-Sightings-VIZ
```

Run the Application locally with localhost or using the deployment

<h2>Data Source</h2>

This data is pulled from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/).

For this project, we have pulled the data together into a single file in ./data/ufo_sighting_NMV.csv and ./data/word_coordinates.csv

For the scope of the project we decided to focus on the USA UFO sightings which had maximum concerntration of sightings. We dropped the other points.

  <summary><b>Motivation of the Project</b></summary>

The motivation for this project was to contribute to the knowledge about the existance of Extraterrestrial activity
and contribute to the documentation and analysis of this cultural phenomenon, adding to the body of knowledge available for researchers, enthusiasts, and the curious alike. We also wanted to hone our data analysis skills in front-end frameworks like D3.Js and Leaflet.js along with using python to analyze and clean the dataset. This data also has first-hand encounters from real people via a reputable
website.

<details><summary><b>Design Specification</b></summary>

* Used a linear page scrollable format (changed our original grid based format) as we wanted a linear flow of selections instead of multiple views together. This facilitiates our story flow during our case studies and findings, mentioned later. 
* Have a story-like feel to the selcted/ brushed plots and result is tracked on the top
* Intutive tool tips with brushing on all
* More info about design specifications to follow

  <summary><b>3. Color Section </b> </summary>
  
For the color of dots on leaflet map:
  - year : Used A linear color scale to represent years, with darker shades indicating older years and lighter shades for younger years.
  - month : Used A sequential color scale to represent months, with different shades of green assigned to each month.
  - Time of Day : Used Fixed colors for each :-  Morning: Yellow, Afternoon: Orange, Evening: Red, Night: Blue. 
  - UFO shape: Used an ordinal color scale to represent different UFO shapes.

For the color of the buttons: 
 - used bright green for all four buttons to keep the theme of alternating green/blue colors all over the website.

For the colors present in Charts:
- Used a mix of blue/green, traditionally used to represent extrateresstrial life. 
- Each chart alternatives between blue and green.

Filtering By WordCloud: 
  - Used white to represent the changes in leaflet map, and indicate a clear change in selection.

  <summary><b>4. Select Attributes</b> </summary>
  <b> (C Goals) Buttons and drop down to select the set of 'color by' options for points on map and switch background </b>

<b> Reasons: </b>

* Geo: How the geography (boundaries, rivers etc.) affects sightings
* Topo: How the Topography (ridges and valleys etc.) affect sightings
* Street: Is it more common to sight near cities or rural areas with less street?
* Airport: More sightings near the airport?

<details>
  <summary><b>6. Timeline</b> </summary>
  <b> (C Goals) Timeline by Year and number of sightings </b>

  <b> Reasons: </b>
  * Small binned bars to show height and spikes
  * Sorted by year
  * Using it to brush the map
  * Consulted professor on not having tool tip on timeline as we think it provides less utility. We deprecated the tool tip feature.

 <details>
  <summary><b> (B Goals) Bar chart for sightings by Months, depicting seasons</b></summary>

  **Reason:** We did not have different colors for seasons as different places have different seasons. Wanted to depict clear frequency change hence decided to go with bar chart.

</details>

 <details>
  <summary><b> (B Goals) Histogram chart for frequency of sightings different times during the day</b></summary>

  **Reason:** Histogram helps with coninuous time intervals throughout the day. 24 hour timing used as it is universal.

<img width="1083" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/USA-UFO-Sightings-VIZ/assets/85262444/80c649ab-f2f5-4ce0-bb9f-6dec58bd80cf">

 <details>
  <summary><b> (B Goals) Emoji based scatter plot to track frequency of occurance of different shapes</b></summary>

  **Reason:** We wanted the user to see the different shapes represented in the plot to be intuitive.

**Reason:** 
* Becasue of the large dataset of shapes, it is slow to load the data. Hence brushing here is slow.
* Professor said it is not easy to use the default brush with D3 hence we came up with alternatives to brush by timeline

<b> (A Goals) Word Cloud to brush the Map</b>

**Reason:** 
* click on the words in the word cloud to see their spatial location and frequency in the map. the word cloud has tool tips and is colors by size. it brushes the map.

<h2>Interesting Findings from the Application</h2>

<details>
<summary><b>Recent Increase in Sightings</b></summary>
<b>It is interesting to note that the number of sightings have increased recently. Maybe due to increased airplanes, drones, people might assume them to be UFOs.</b>
<img width="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SaumickPradhan/USA-UFO-Sightings-VIZ/assets/85262444/a015a9f5-ccaf-4904-9710-a06509f9cd8b">
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>More sightings at night</b></summary>
  
<b>More sigthings seen at night, as shining objects, shooting stars and other entities are often confused with UFOs</b>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Common words are White and Light</b></summary>
<b>This shows that the sightings are commonly associated with sparkling flash lights (especially at night). Maybe stars.</b>
